jsgames
=======

A quick and dirty primer for creating canvas games with input and an animation loop.

Disclaimer: The CSS has not been written with performance or cross-browser compatibility in mind, mostly just to provide a quick and dirty sample in Chrome.  For handling issues such as FOUT when using Google Fonts and vendor-specific styles, please refer to the links in the reference section.

**Concepts:**
- Module vs Thing.prototype.function
- Animating a canvas element in vanilla javascript
- Maintaining a particle array and updating position

(work in progress)

**Run it:**
- Navigate into the folder with index.html
- run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`
- go to localhost:8000 in your browser
